    "HOU showed better performance on onground time but get relatively low score on total delay or cancellation rate. In cancelation data, since HOU has lower rate of weather caused cancellation(58.8%) than IAH's (78%), HOU has potential to improve the system on it for its relatively better weather conditions.Also, HOU need to work harder on dealing with total delay.The delay at HOU is quite dramatical.
