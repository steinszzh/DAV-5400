### DAV 5400 Final Project Proposal
#### Team member: Zhihong Zhang.
## Introduction
Nowadays, social media plays a crucial role in our daily life. Based on one of the recent statistics,79% of American internet users are on Facebook. Along with this fact, there is also an enlarging need for advertisement and commercial marketing on social media.88% of social marketers said that it’s important for their brands to provide customer service through social media.

Since the Facebook is one of the most influential social media nowadays, this research will focus on the product advertisement on Facebook. Ideally, the research can find some interesting patterns and it can be generalized into other social medial platforms.

## Research Questions
The main question I have for this research will be the correlation between different variables within a Facebook product page. For example, how the interaction between users and post impact the product brand building. Other questions raised will also be based on the main question, and the focus is to find the main factors affecting marketing efficiency.

After finding the pattern of the data set, I would like to validate generalization of the model by using other data collected from web.

I believe the model can be used to make each post efficient on social media is very beneficial for the advertisement.It not only can reduce the unnecessary cost on advertisement but it also can help different brands to efficiently communicate with the customers.In general, it is an optimization process of the advertisement.

Data to be Used
The first data set that will be used for this research comes from UCI repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Facebook+metrics# The data set is a csv file, and it can be easily loaded into python by simple one line of code.This data set is about a renowned cosmetic brand product on a Facebook page, and it is used to generate the observable pattern and visualization.

For the second of the data, I aim to use it to testify the correction of the model which was created by previous visualization. Based on this needs, I plan to either web clip the information on the Facebook or the open api.

If both goals can be served, and there is enough time to work. The potential third source can also be introduced, and it will be a slight different social media such as YouTube or Twitter. The similar mechanism of second data set, such as web clipping or using api, will also be used to collect the data.

## Approach
The first data set can be stored in data frame by using the built-in read csv function. For this data set, I plan to generate descriptive statistics for the exploratory data analysis. For example, I will generate the bar chat to compare the difference between paid advertisement and free product page. Also, multi-correlation will be checked between these attributes. And after these processes, I will use the regression method for modeling to create a model.

After analyzing the pattern of this data set, I would like to check whether it is a general pattern of the social media advertisement. The other data that can be directly from the web using API or data mining through python. This data mainly is used to testify the generalization of the model. If the new product on Facebook can be generalized based on the first model. For example, the 80% more of new testing product data fall within prediction line.

Only when other Facebook data test is proved true and there will be enough time left, an extra testing will be used to testify the generalization in other social media platform. Also, the similar mechanism from second data set will be used.
