For example, if your research questions are focused on a health related issue, you might provide a brief summary of how many people are affected by that issue each year either regionally, nationally or globally, including any infection rate or mortality statistics you were able to gather. Basically, in the Introduction you are trying to make the reader understand why the research questions you are going to propose are relevant and should be of interest to them.*"
